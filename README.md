# My_DataScience_Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio — a collection of projects, experiments, and learnings that demonstrate my journey and skills in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and AI.
This repository serves as a central hub for all my work, organized by project type and topic.

This portfolio highlights my end-to-end understanding of the data science workflow, including:

 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (insights, visualization, correlation analysis)

 Statistical Analysis (hypothesis testing, feature selection)

 Machine Learning Models (classification, regression, clustering)

 Model Evaluation & Optimization (cross-validation, confusion matrix, hyperparameter tuning)

 Data Handling Tools (SQL, Pandas, NumPy)

 Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, Plotly)


**Tools & Technologies**

Category	Tools / Libraries
Languages	Python, SQL
Data Manipulation	Pandas, NumPy

**Learning Journey**

This portfolio represents my hands-on learning path — from foundational data exploration to building predictive models.

Key areas of focus:

Building real-world, domain-specific projects (Banking, Healthcare, Cricket, etc.)

Implementing ML algorithms from scratch

Understanding model evaluation metrics



**Connect With Me**
I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and new opportunities in data science.
